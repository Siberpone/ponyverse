[# Scenery Block ]
[##]
	Generates scenery description.

	<n> - mandatory parameter that specifies the number of descriptions to
		generate.
	<group> - optional parameter that specifies scenery group like "place"
		or "weather". See pv/thesaurus/scenery/ for available categories.

	TODO:
		- tune weights. The block takes away too much attention from the character,
			sometimes to the point where the character doesn't show up. Weeding out
			"attention-grabbing" options from thesaurus also should help.
		- expand related thesaurus

	BLOCK QUALITY: poor
