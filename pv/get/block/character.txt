[# Character Block ]
[##]
	Fetches a random character from the thesaurus. Groups are weighted according
	to a number of characters they contain to ensure even character distribution.
	Mane 6 and support cast have slightly higher weights, so they appear slightly
	more often. Some groups may have teir own internal weights.

	<group> - optional parameter that specifies a group to choose a character from.	 

	TODO:
		- see if Astra V4 knows any other characters
		- see how to populate character lists in ui programmatically (probably not
			possible with current unprompted capabilities)

	BLOCK QUALITY: good
